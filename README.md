# uk-grid-simulation
This repository contains source code for analyses and simulations of the UK electricity grid.  

There will be three simulations:
- Wind, solar and gas alone
- Wind, solar, gas and storage
- Nuclear + wind, solar, gas, storage

These simulations formed the based of articles I wrote on this subject that can be found on my LinkedIn Profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-chapman-59670536/
